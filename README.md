# Collaborative-Pickup-and-Delivery-Problem-with-Time-Windows
This database contains a set of experimental problems designed to study horizontal cooperation among a set of carriers with large-scale pickup and delivery problems with time windows. More specifically, the dataset can be used to determine the coalition structure subject to maximum cardinality constraint per coalition. We used existing benchmarks developed and maintained by SINTEF (https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/top/pdptw/li-lim-benchmark/) to generated instances.
Besides, these instances can be used as test problems to study the other aspects of cooperative (collaborative) pickup and delivery problem with time windows.
These instances are initially generated in a study entitled “A Coalition Structure Algorithm for Large-scale Collaborative Pickup and Delivery Problem” which will be appeared in Computers and Industrial Engineering.
